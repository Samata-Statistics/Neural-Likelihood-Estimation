# Neural-Likelihood-Estimation
This project is based on the likelihood estimation when likelihood is intractable. A sort of toy example I am using here as a project to give an idea about how does it work. So in future, I want to use this similar method in my research area. 
According to the objective of this project I want to work on conjugate priors, such as Normal-Normal, Beta-Binomial distribution families. My goal is to check how accurate my method is while obtaining estimated likelihood for these give families and then to use it to obtain estimated posterior distribution which I want to compare with the actual ones. As I mentioned earlier already this is just a toy example, here likelihood is definitely not intractable. However, in real life we definitely can face this issue.
