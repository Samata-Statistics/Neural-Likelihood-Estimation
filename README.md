# Neural-Likelihood-Estimation
This project is based on the likelihood estimation when likelihood is intractable. A sort of toy example I am using here as a project to give an idea about how does it work. So in future, I want to use this similar method in my research area. 

# Methodology behind obtaining estimated likelihood
This is a block equation:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$



# Approach towards solution
