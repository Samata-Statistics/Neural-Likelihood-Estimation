# Neural-Likelihood-Estimation
This project is based on the likelihood estimation when likelihood is intractable. A sort of toy example I am using here as a project to give an idea about how does it work. So in future, I want to use this similar method in my research area. 

# Methodology behind obtaining estimated likelihood
The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality is also expressed as:
```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)


# Approach towards solution
